<li><p>Level of relationship building needed: High. Developing a cohesive kitchen team and establishing rapport with regular customers are crucial.</p></li>
<li><p>Depth of interpersonal understanding required: High. Understanding the dynamics within the kitchen and the tastes and preferences of the clientele.</p></li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI Replaceability:</strong></li>
