<h3 id="finalcreativityscorecalculation">Final Creativity Score Calculation</h3>
<p><strong>Conducting Interviews:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity = High (6.0)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developing Rehabilitation Plans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creativity = High (7.0)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Evaluating Progress:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Composite Score Calculation:</strong>
(Higher weight on highly creative tasks):
[ \frac{(6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 5.5 + (-3.0) \times 0.5)}{4.5} = 20.5 / 4.5 = 4.56 ]</p>
<p><strong>Final Creativity Score:</strong></p>
<p>The job of a Probation Officer falls towards the significant creative part of the spectrum due to the high level of human judgment, strategic thinking, and original idea generation required in most tasks.</p>
